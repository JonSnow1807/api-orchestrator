```python
class CloudAgent:
    - Deploy to AWS/GCP/Azure
    - Configure load balancers
    - Set up monitoring
    - Handle auto-scaling
    - Manage secrets
```

### 4. üíÄ **CHAOS ENGINEERING AGENT** (Unique)
```python
class ChaosAgent:
    """Breaks things to make them stronger"""
    - Inject random failures
    - Test disaster recovery
    - Simulate DDoS attacks
    - Network partition testing
    - Data corruption testing
```

### 5. üéØ **BUSINESS VALUE ENGINE**
```python
class BusinessValueCalculator:
    """Shows ROI of every action"""
    - Calculate cost of vulnerabilities
    - Estimate fix implementation time
    - Priority based on revenue impact
    - Compliance penalty avoidance
    - Customer satisfaction metrics
```
