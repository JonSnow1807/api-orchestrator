2. **WebSocket Real-time Features**
   - Basic connection management works
   - Auto-reconnection implemented
   - Limited event handling

3. **Code Generation**
   - SDK generation works
   - UI exists but limited languages
   - Package publishing not implemented

### ❌ Missing/Disabled Features
1. **Webhook Routes** - Disabled due to SQLAlchemy relationship issues
2. **AI Keys Management** - Disabled due to SQLAlchemy relationship issues
3. **Test Runner with Assertions** - No actual test execution
4. **Pre/Post Request Scripts** - Not implemented
5. **Postman Collection Import** - Not implemented
6. **CLI Tool** - Not implemented (Newman equivalent)
7. **Scheduled Monitoring** - Not implemented
8. **Response Validation** - Not implemented

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. SQLAlchemy Relationship Problem
**Location**: `/backend/src/models/workspace.py`
**Issue**: Ambiguous foreign keys in Workspace model preventing webhook/AI key routes from loading
**Impact**: Two major features completely disabled
**Fix Required**: Specify primaryjoin/foreignkeys in relationships

### 2. Missing Test Execution Engine
**Current State**: Test generation works but no execution
**Missing**:
- Assertion framework
- Test runner
- Result reporting
- CI/CD integration

### 3. Import/Export Limitations
**Current State**: Basic export works
**Missing**:
- Postman collection import
- HAR file import
- Insomnia import
- OpenAPI import improvements

### 4. Frontend Performance
**Issue**: Bundle size is 2.2MB
**Causes**:
- Monaco Editor
- Multiple UI libraries
- No code splitting
- No lazy loading

## Security Analysis

### ✅ Implemented
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (via Slowapi)
- SQL injection protection (SQLAlchemy ORM)
- Path traversal protection

### ⚠️ Concerns
- API keys stored in plain text
- No request signing for webhooks
- Missing CSRF protection
- No 2FA implementation
- Secrets potentially in environment variables

## Performance Considerations

### Backend
- Async FastAPI provides good performance
- Database connection pooling configured
- WebSocket connection management needs optimization
- No caching layer implemented
- No background job queue

### Frontend
- Large bundle size (2.2MB)
- No code splitting
- No service worker
- No CDN integration
- React 18 with concurrent features not utilized

## Database Schema Issues

### Workspace Model Relationships
```python
# Problem: Ambiguous relationships
creator = relationship("User", foreign_keys=[created_by], backref="owned_workspaces")
members = relationship("User", secondary=workspace_members, ...)
```

### Missing Indexes
- No composite indexes for common queries
- Missing indexes on foreign keys
- No full-text search indexes

4. **Modern UI** - Cleaner than Postman
5. **Price Point** - More features at lower cost

### Critical Gaps vs Postman
1. **No Test Runner** - Can't execute tests
2. **No Import** - High migration barrier
3. **No CLI** - Can't integrate with CI/CD
4. **No Scripts** - Limited automation
5. **Limited Collaboration** - Team features incomplete

## Deployment Considerations

### Current Setup
- **Local**: SQLite + development server
- **Production**: Railway with PostgreSQL
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (basic)
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for errors

### Improvements Needed
- Container orchestration
- Health checks
- Backup strategy
- Load balancing
- Monitoring/alerting

## Conclusion

API Orchestrator is a well-architected application with strong foundations and unique AI-powered features. However, it lacks critical testing infrastructure and import capabilities that would be necessary for widespread adoption. The codebase is production-ready but needs immediate attention to:

1. Fix disabled features (webhooks, AI keys)
2. Implement test execution engine
3. Add import capabilities
4. Optimize performance

With 1-2 weeks of focused development, this product could achieve feature parity with Postman while maintaining its unique advantages in AI intelligence and code generation.
