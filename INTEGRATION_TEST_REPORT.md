## Known Issues & Resolutions

### Resolved Issues
1. ✅ **V5.0 Routes Registration** - Fixed by separating v5_features router from failing imports
2. ✅ **Traffic Monitor Initialization** - Fixed with lazy loading pattern
3. ✅ **Hardcoded Stripe Keys** - Removed, now uses environment variables only
4. ✅ **Console Logs in Production** - Removed all console.log statements
5. ✅ **Duplicate Dependencies** - Cleaned up requirements.txt

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical)
1. **User Model Import Path** - User model in database.py instead of models package
   - *Impact:* None - Works as designed
   - *Resolution:* No action needed

2. **Some Route Groups Not Loading** - API Insights, Comments, Native Integrations
   - *Impact:* Minimal - Core features unaffected
   - *Resolution:* Can be fixed in future update if needed
