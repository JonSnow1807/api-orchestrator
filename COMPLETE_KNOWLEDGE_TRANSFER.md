## 🛠 CodeRabbit Setup and Usage

### Installation
```bash
# Install CodeRabbit CLI
curl -fsSL https://cli.coderabbit.ai/install.sh | sh

# Add to PATH (if not automatic)
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"

# Verify installation
coderabbit --version  # Should show: 0.3.1 or later
```

### Authentication
```bash
# Authenticate with CodeRabbit
coderabbit auth login

# When prompted, go to the URL and authenticate with GitHub
# Paste the token when asked
# You should see: "Authentication successful! Welcome JonSnow1807"
```

### API Key (if needed)
```
API Key: cr-bd4f404fa2957c3ac584c54da743abbfe446e6dda886d3889618acd327
```

### Usage Commands
```bash
# Review all changes
coderabbit review --plain

# Review with minimal output
coderabbit review --prompt-only

# Review specific types
coderabbit review --type committed    # Review committed changes
coderabbit review --type uncommitted  # Review uncommitted changes
coderabbit review --type all         # Review everything

# With API key (if rate limited)
CODERABBIT_API_KEY="cr-bd4f404fa2957c3ac584c54da743abbfe446e6dda886d3889618acd327" coderabbit review --plain
```

### Known Issues
- **Rate Limiting**: CodeRabbit has rate limits. Wait if you hit them.
- **Output**: Review completes but may not always show detailed output
- **Best Practice**: Review specific directories or files rather than entire codebase

## ⚠️ Unverified/False Claims to Avoid
These claims appear in documentation but are NOT verified:
- ❌ "80,709 tests/second" - No implementation found
- ❌ "<100ms response time" - Not benchmarked
- ❌ "100% detection rate" - Not measured
- ❌ "59 snapshots/second" - Not benchmarked
- ❌ "10,000+ concurrent users" - Not tested
- ❌ "100% critical path coverage" - Coverage unknown

## ✅ Accurate Professional Description
Use this for resumes/portfolios:

```

## 📝 Development Workflow
1. Always verify claims before adding to documentation
2. Use CodeRabbit for code reviews (respect rate limits)
3. Commit under JonSnow1807 name only
4. Test counts vary by method - use conservative estimates
5. Kubernetes is NOT fully implemented - only Docker
6. TypeScript is NOT used - only JavaScript/JSX
