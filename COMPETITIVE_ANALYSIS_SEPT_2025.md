2. **Public API Documentation** - Generate beautiful docs like Postman
3. **Request Chaining** - Use response data in subsequent requests
4. **Pre-request Scripts** - JavaScript execution before requests
5. **Test Snippets Library** - Common test patterns ready to use

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Build CLI Tool** - This is CRITICAL for developer adoption
   - Login/auth commands
   - Run collections
   - CI/CD integration
   - OpenAPI linting

2. **Add Newman Compatibility** - Allow running Postman collections
   - This enables immediate migration
   - Reduces switching friction

3. **Implement API Monitors** - Scheduled health checks
   - Cron-based monitoring
   - Alert notifications
   - Status pages

### Medium Term (1 Month)
1. **Visual Workflows** - Drag-drop API chaining
2. **Load Testing** - K6 or Artillery integration
3. **Contract Testing** - Schema validation
4. **API Documentation** - Public shareable docs

### Our Unique Selling Points (Keep Emphasizing)
1. **100% FREE** - No user limits, no feature gates
2. **Privacy-First** - Your data never trains models
3. **Open Source** - Audit the code, self-host, customize
4. **Offline-First** - Works without internet
5. **No Vendor Lock-in** - Export everything, own your data

## Market Positioning

### Target Users (In Order)
1. **Privacy-Conscious Teams** - Healthcare, Finance, Government
2. **Budget-Conscious Startups** - Can't afford Postman's $588/year
3. **Open Source Advocates** - Want transparency and control

### Marketing Message
"API Orchestrator: The Open Source Postman Alternative That's Actually Better"
- 100% Free Forever
- Privacy-First Design
- No Vendor Lock-in
- Works Offline
- Unlimited Everything

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: CLI Tool (CRITICAL - 1 Week)
```bash
# What we need:
api-orchestrator login
api-orchestrator run collection.json
api-orchestrator lint openapi.yaml
api-orchestrator test --env production
```

### Phase 2: Newman Compatibility (HIGH - 3 Days)
- Import Postman collections
- Run with same commands
- Export results in Newman format

### Phase 3: Monitors & Docs (HIGH - 1 Week)
- Scheduled monitoring
- Public documentation
- Status pages

## Conclusion

We're **85% there** to being a true Postman killer. The missing 15% is mostly around:
1. **CLI/CI Integration** (Critical for developers)
2. **API Governance** (Critical for enterprises)
3. **Advanced Testing** (Load, contract, monitors)

With 2-3 weeks of focused development on these gaps, API Orchestrator can legitimately claim to be a complete Postman replacement while offering unique advantages that Postman can't match (free, open source, privacy-first, offline-capable).

## Next Steps
1. Implement CLI tool immediately
2. Add Newman compatibility for easy migration
3. Build monitors and public docs
4. Market aggressively to privacy-conscious and budget-conscious teams
5. Emphasize our unique advantages in all communications
