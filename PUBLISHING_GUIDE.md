- Once published, you can't delete (only yank versions)
- Use TestPyPI first to avoid mistakes
- Version numbers can't be reused

### VS Code:
- Publisher ID can't be changed once created
- Extension ID = publisher.extensionName
- Updates are automatic for users
- Review process is automated (usually instant)

## 🎯 For Y Combinator Pitch

After publishing, you can say:

> "API Orchestrator is already in production with:
> - **PyPI**: `pip install api-orchestrator` - reaching 31M Python developers
> - **VS Code Marketplace**: 74M+ potential users
> - **Zero distribution costs** - both platforms are free
> - **Instant global availability** - no barriers to adoption"

This demonstrates:
- ✅ Production readiness
- ✅ Distribution channels established
- ✅ Professional execution
- ✅ Scalable go-to-market strategy

---

## 📅 Timeline

**Total Time Required: ~30 minutes**

1. Create accounts (10 min)
2. Configure tokens (5 min)
3. Build packages (5 min)
4. Test locally (5 min)
5. Publish both (5 min)

**Do this BEFORE your YC pitch!** It adds massive credibility.

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### PyPI Issues:
- "Invalid distribution": Run `python -m build` instead of `setup.py`
- "Authentication failed": Check token in ~/.pypirc
- "Name exists": Add suffix like `-cli` or `-tool`

### VS Code Issues:
- "Unauthorized": Regenerate PAT with Marketplace manage scope
- "Publisher not found": Create at marketplace.visualstudio.com first
- "Invalid manifest": Check package.json required fields
